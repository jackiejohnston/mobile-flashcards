# Mobile Flashcards

This is an app built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that allows users to create decks of flashcards and quiz themselves.

## Step 1
If you don't already have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package installer, install it with the [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html) package manager:

```
$  brew install yarn --without-node
```

You'll also need [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app):
```
$  yarn global add create-react-native-app
```

## Step 2
Download, install and run this app in [Expo](https://expo.io):

```
$  git clone git@github.com:jackiejohnston/mobile-flashcards.git
$  cd mobile-flashcards
$  yarn
$  yarn start
```

Install the [Expo](https://expo.io/) client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. Using the Expo app, scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project on your phone. Or to run on your desktop, just enter `a` to open Android device or emulator, or `i` to open iOS emulator. (Please note, this app has only been tested for iOS on the desktop Simulator.)
